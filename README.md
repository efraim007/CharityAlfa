The aim of Cryptogcoin is to provide a charity system to the world, which is based on the modern tehcnology called blockchain, and connect the needy with donators and investors.

To give a tool into the people hands, called the Investment Charity.

Cryptogcoin can be used for financial transactions and accounting of course, what a crypto coin is for, but Cryptogcoin, as a virtual currency just a small piece of the puzzle.

The 4 elements of the system:

Charity Auction System
Charity Mining System
Charity Transfer System
Volunteer Mining System
This system called the Cryptog Blockcharity System or Charity Alfa.

We assume that money needed for charity, if someone want to donate an organization. You have to earn that money, what can be spent to charity, and it generates an self-circulating cycle. Invest into charity! â€“ that is our slogan. Besides our system contains the incentives of the basic charitable actions, which do not need money, but human will.

The parts of the system are complex and closely linked together. There is only one goal, to achieve the institution of Investment Charity.
